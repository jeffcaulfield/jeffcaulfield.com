        <p>I tried a variety of static site generators on my way to rebuilding my personal website: <a href="https://hexo.io/">hexo</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> and <a href="https://sculpin.io/">sculpin</a>, just to name a few. These all seem very complicated for what they purport to be, and definitely overkill for my needs.</p>
<p>Eventually, I stumbled across <a href="http://boscoh.github.io/embellish/">embellish</a>. It's written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. It's very lightweight. It doesn't require a ton of files to get started. I was able to get something off the ground quickly without becoming bogged down in excessive detail. Very nice.</p>
<p>That said, I feel that there's some "fat" that could yet be trimmed. I  don't understand the need to use <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> for templates when <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a> is fine on its own. I'm not using compiled assets (<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and so forth), although that's not to say that I might not want to do so later on. I'd like the command-line to auto-detect "site.yaml" when it is present. I'd also like to remove or at least rename the "site.cache" file.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are a few small but important features that are missing. A <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">sitemap</a> and a syndication feed in <a href="http://atomenabled.org/">Atom</a> and/or <a href="http://www.whatisrss.com/">RSS</a> format should be a given. A "draft" mode for content in progress also seems essential. Pagination would be useful for large archive indexes. Finally, I'd like a simple way to add site-specific extensions (Python scripts) to customise the render process, if at all possible.</p>
<p>This all seems acheivable. I think I'll call it <a href="https://github.com/jeffcaulfield/gild">gild</a> as in "gilding the lily" in keeping with the theme of embellishment.</p>
<p>What could <em>possibly</em> go wrong?</p>
