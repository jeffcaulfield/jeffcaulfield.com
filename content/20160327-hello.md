This is only a test. If this were a real blog post you would be bored to tears by now.

I built a new personal website using [embellish](http://boscoh.github.io/embellish). The following links were useful in the process.

- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [HAML reference](http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.REFERENCE.html)
- [Hamlish-jinja](https://github.com/Pitmairen/hamlish-jinja)
- [The article element](http://html5doctor.com/the-article-element/)
- [MinimalCSS](http://minimalcss.com/)

Still to do:

- Article categories/tags and archive page.
- Roll my own [Python](http://python.org)-based static site generator.
- Curriculum vitae (maybe)
- Pet projects and links to interesting stuff
