I've built a new personal website using [embellish](http://boscoh.github.io/embellish) with [MinimalCSS](http://minimalcss.com/). I found the following links useful during this process.

- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [HAML reference](http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.REFERENCE.html)
- [Hamlish-jinja](https://github.com/Pitmairen/hamlish-jinja)
- [The article element](http://html5doctor.com/the-article-element/)
