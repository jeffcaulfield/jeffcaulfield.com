I decided to write my own static site generator. What could possibly go wrong?
---

I tried a wide variety of static site generators on my way to rebuilding my personal website: [hexo](https://hexo.io/), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [sculpin](https://sculpin.io/), just to name a few. These all seem far too complicated for what they are meant to do, and definitely overkill for what I need.

After some searching, I finally stumbled across [embellish](http://boscoh.github.io/embellish/). It's very lightweight. It doesn't require a ton of files to get started. It's written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). TK: what else I liked about it, what seemed to be lacking or unnecessary for my needs, why I felt I should write my own SSG...

(To be continued...)
