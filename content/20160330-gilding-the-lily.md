I tried out a wide variety of static site generators on my way to rebuilding my personal website: [hexo](https://hexo.io/), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [sculpin](https://sculpin.io/), to name a few. They all seemed far too complicated for what they do, and definitely overkill for what I needed.

After some searching, I finally stumbled across [embellish](http://boscoh.github.io/embellish/).
